# PCO-XR — Phase-Coupled Optimization for Extended Reality

PCO-XR is an early-stage framework exploring how comfort, presence, and stability in XR systems can be treated as controllable dynamical states rather than indirect consequences of frame rate or latency.  

> This repository documents models, invariants, and reference loops—not a finished product or SDK.

## What’s in this repo
- Conceptual models of XR comfort dynamics
- Reference control loops
- Definitions of key terms and axes
- Pseudocode sketches for loop implementation
- Discussion of failure modes and measurement limitations

## What this repo is not
- A production library or engine plugin
- A product claiming to eliminate motion or simulation sickness
- Platform-specific implementations (Unity, Unreal, OpenXR)
- Benchmarks or performance claims

## Who this is for
- XR engineers and system programmers
- Designers working close to perceptual fidelity
- Researchers in human-computer interaction, perception, or control systems

## Status
This project is intentionally incomplete. Expect gaps, open questions, and evolving definitions.

---

## Getting Involved
- Read through the docs and models
- Engage in discussions or open issues
- Suggest terminology refinements, counterexamples, or failure cases
- Share insights from real-world XR experience

> PCO-XR is not finished. It’s barely begun. That’s exactly why now is the right time to talk about it.
