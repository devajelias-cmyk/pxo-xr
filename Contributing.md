# Contributing to PCO-XR

Thank you for your interest in contributing! PCO-XR is early-stage, so contributions can take many forms: critique, counterexamples, failed experiments, or discussion.

### Guidelines
- Respectful critique is encouraged
- Counterexamples welcome; no need to agree with the framework
- Use plain language and references where possible
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Avoid claiming this is a product or solution

### How to contribute
1. Read through the docs and models
2. Open an issue or start a discussion
3. Submit pull requests if adding clarifying docs, pseudocode, or examples
4. Starter Issues
Here are five initial issues to seed engagement:

Where does the PCO model break down?

Identify situations where phase-coupled modeling may fail to predict discomfort.

Measurement and observability limits

Discuss which physiological or system signals are realistically measurable, and where assumptions are too optimistic.

Terminology refinement

Suggest changes, clarifications, or additions to axes, μ, crown constraints, and other key concepts.

Counterexamples to comfort loops

Provide real-world examples where current control loops might fail or misalign with user experience.

Mapping heuristics to PCO axes

How do traditional XR comfort strategies (vignettes, FOV narrowing, motion constraints) map to phase, coupling, or μ in the framework?

5. Optional Extras
Enable GitHub Discussions to host “theory vs. practice” debates

Add a Wiki only if you need more structured reference material later

Consider a small diagram folder for loop sketches or flowcharts

If you want, I can also write a full first commit for you — including:

README.md fully formatted

docs/overview.md draft

models/control-loops.md starter

pseudocode/md sketches
