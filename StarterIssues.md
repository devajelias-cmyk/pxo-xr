Starter Issues

Here are five initial issues to seed engagement:

Where does the PCO model break down?

Identify situations where phase-coupled modeling may fail to predict discomfort.

Measurement and observability limits

Discuss which physiological or system signals are realistically measurable, and where assumptions are too optimistic.

Terminology refinement

Suggest changes, clarifications, or additions to axes, μ, crown constraints, and other key concepts.

Counterexamples to comfort loops

Provide real-world examples where current control loops might fail or misalign with user experience.

Mapping heuristics to PCO axes

How do traditional XR comfort strategies (vignettes, FOV narrowing, motion constraints) map to phase, coupling, or μ in the framework?
